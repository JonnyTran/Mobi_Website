so changing the background will change the little line ( not sure about border ). Although I'm not sure why but it won't acceppt the #0088CC value that is the rest of the page
but it will accept other hex values. No idea, too tired going to nap

added a responsive qualifier (visible-lg which only makes the side navbar visible on a large screen) 
to the "Our Projects page". To test, just open it on your computer and squeeze the screen to a smaller 
size - it should completely disappear.
------------------
quick note, code envy sucks, half of the changes I make don't get saved for some reason and I have to refresh the page and change it again. Potential big issue and could be the cause of alot of other problems.
also, how od I word wrap this crap

fixed top nav bar background color issues, just add an id tag to each of the class = col-mid-X tags and change bg color on css page, not sure why this wasn't done before as I'm sure one of us tried that already

added above fix to the rest of the pages

<hr> tag is a nice idea, but the navbars have a slight gray outline underneath them, not sure why.

added some comments and tried to fix spacing, although code envy does some auto space crap that is awful andwil
